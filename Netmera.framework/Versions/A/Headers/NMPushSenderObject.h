/**
 * NMPushSenderObject class is used to send plain-text push notification to the devices with certain properties. 
 *  By using this class, different properties that serve your needs of the push notification can be set. By default, 
 *  you have to set 'Title' and 'Alert Text' properties. Other properties are optional. Just if 'Token' property is set,
 *  'Tags' and 'Platforms' properties will be ignored. In Netmera Push Backend Service, token has higher priority.
 *  'Location Info' and 'Platform' properties are readonly, however, these properties can be set via 
 *  setPushCircleLocationInfoWithCenterLocation:distance:, setPushBoxLocationInfoWithFirstLocation:secondLocation:
 *  and setTargetPushPlatform: methods in order to prevent to send invalid values.
