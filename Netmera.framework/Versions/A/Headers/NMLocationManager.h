/**
 * NMLocationManager is a service that enables developers to location tracking for push notifications. If you want to
 *  send locational push notifications and if you use this service you do not need to track device locations. This
 *  service automatically updates device location. When your users get closer to specific location, you can send
 *  automated push messages to them in certain time interval.
 *
 *  @note It is recommended to use this class when high-precision location data is required. However, if just regular
 *  position updates are enough for the application, Netmera SDK default location tracking mechanism is more than
 *  enough; otherwise, the parameters of this service should be configured in a way that minimizes its impact on battery
 *  life.
